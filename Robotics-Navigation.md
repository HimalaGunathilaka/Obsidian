## Reactive navigation
- `A goal oriented machine that can sense and act.`
- 
### Braitenberg vehicles
- Simple goal achieving robots which are characterized by direct connection between sensors and motors.
__Sensor__ --> __Actuator__
- 
### Simple automata
- Class of reactive robots known as bugs that perform goal seeking in the presense of nondriveable areas or obstacles. 
- The bug has state machine between the sensor and the motors.
__Sensor__ --> Automata --> __Motor__ 
## Map-based planning
- ```A goal oriented machine that can sense, plan and act.```
- A popular algorithm for robot path planning is D* (Dynamic A*).
- __Distance transform__ - Consider a matrix of zeros with just a single element representing the goal. The distance transform of this matrix is another matrix, of the same size but the value of each element is its distance from the original non zero  pixel.
### Road-mapping
- The analysis of map is the planning phase of robotic path planning.
### Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM)

### Lattice Planner
### Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT)
