- A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if **none of them can be written as a combination of the others**.
- ### 🧠 The confusion:

The mathematical definition uses an equation:

c1v1+c2v2+⋯+cnvn=0c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \dots + c_nv_n = 0c1​v1​+c2​v2​+⋯+cn​vn​=0

and says:

> “If the **only** way to make zero is using all ci=0c_i = 0ci​=0, then they’re linearly independent.”

That may feel backwards at first — but it's actually a precise way to say:

- **Eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues of a matrix are linearly independent.**
