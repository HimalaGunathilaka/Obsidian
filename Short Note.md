- A set of vectors is **linearly independent** if **none of them can be written as a combination of the others**.

### 🧠 The confusion

The mathematical definition uses an equation:

```
c₁v₁ + c₂v₂ + ⋯ + cₙvₙ = 0
```

and says:

> “If the **only** way to make zero is using all `cᵢ = 0`, then they’re linearly independent.”

That may feel backwards at first — but it's actually a precise way to say:

- **Eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues of a matrix are linearly independent.**

| **Generalized eigenvectors** | Vectors that help "fill in" when eigenvectors are missing   |

## 📌 What's a Generalized Eigenvector?

For a square matrix **A** and an eigenvalue **λ**, a **generalized eigenvector** is a vector **v** that satisfies:

```
(A − λI)^k v = 0
```

for **some smallest integer** `k > 1`, **but**:

```
(A − λI)^(k−1) v ≠ 0
```

That is:

- **v** doesn’t satisfy `(A − λI)v = 0` (so it's **not** a regular eigenvector),
- But applying `(A − λI)` **repeatedly** will eventually zero it out.

## 🧠 The Kernel

The **kernel** (also called the **null space**) of a matrix **A** is the set of **all vectors** **x** such that:

```
A x = 0
```

### ✅ When we say:

> "The **dimension** of the kernel"

We mean:

> The number of **basis vectors** needed to **span the kernel**.

## ✅ Step 1: Set up the Equation

You want to find **non-zero vectors** `v` such that:

```
A * v = λ * v
```

Rewriting:

```
(A − λI) * v = 0
```

This is a **homogeneous system of linear equations** — you're looking for the **null space** (or **kernel**) of the matrix `A − λI`.

---

## ✅ Step 2: Solve the Kernel (Null Space)

1. Compute `A − λI`.
2. Solve the system:

```
(A − λI) * v = 0
```

This means finding all vectors `v` that are sent to the **zero vector** by the matrix `A − λI`.

- These `v` are your **eigenvectors** for the given eigenvalue `λ`.
- The solution set will typically have **infinitely many vectors** — all scalar multiples of a basis vector (or multiple basis vectors if the eigenspace has higher dimension).

## 🔁 What does it mean when we say:

> "**Matrix AAA is similar to matrix BBB**"?

It means:

	A=PBP−1\boxed{A = PBP^{-1}}A=PBP−1​

for some **invertible matrix** PPP.

- The **number of Jordan blocks** = **geometric multiplicity**.
    
- The **sum of sizes** of the blocks = **algebraic multiplicity**.
