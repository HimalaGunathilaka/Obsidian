# How to Find the Jordan Normal Form

## Goal:
Find matrices \( J \) and \( P \) such that:
$$[
A = P J P^{-1}
]$$
where \( J \) is the Jordan normal form.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### ✅ Step 1: Find the Eigenvalues
- Solve the characteristic polynomial:
  $$[
  \det(A - \lambda I) = 0
  ]$$
- The roots $( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots )$ are the eigenvalues.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Find Algebraic Multiplicity (AM)
- For each eigenvalue, find how many times it repeats as a root in the characteristic polynomial.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Find Geometric Multiplicity (GM)
- For each eigenvalue \( \lambda \), compute:
  $$[
  dim(\ker(A - \lambda I)) = \text{number of linearly independent eigenvectors for } lambda
  ]$$

---

### ✅ Step 4: Determine Jordan Block Structure
- Number of Jordan blocks for each eigenvalue = GM.
- Sum of the sizes of these blocks = AM.
- For example, if AM = 3 and GM = 1, then there is one Jordan block of size 3.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Find Generalized Eigenvectors
- If GM < AM, find generalized eigenvectors by solving:
  $$[
  (A - \lambda I)^k v = 0 \quad \text{for smallest } k > 1
  ]
  but
  [
  (A - \lambda I)^{k-1} v \neq 0
  ]$$
- These vectors form chains that complete the basis.

---

### ✅ Step 6: Construct Matrix \( P \)
- Arrange eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors as columns of \( P \).
- Order them so that in each Jordan block, the chain goes from the generalized eigenvector to the eigenvector.

---

### ✅ Step 7: Form the Jordan Matrix \( J \)
- \( J \) is block diagonal, each block is a Jordan block:
  $$
  J_k(\lambda) =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \lambda & 1      & 0      & \cdots & 0 \\
  0       & \lambda & 1     & \cdots & 0 \\
  0       & 0       & \lambda & \cdots & 0 \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & 1 \\
  0       & 0       & 0       & \cdots & \lambda
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
