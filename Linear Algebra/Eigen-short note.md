# 🧮 Matrix Concepts Summary

## 🔁 Characteristic Equation
- Defined as: `det(A - λI) = 0`
- Purpose: Find eigenvalues of a matrix.
- Result: A polynomial in λ (the characteristic polynomial).
- Roots = Eigenvalues of matrix A.

## 🔄 Inverse of a Matrix

### Methods:
- **Adajoint/Determinant**: 
  - Formula: `A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) * adj(A)`
  - Good for small matrices.

- **Gaussian Elimination**:
  - Most efficient and stable method.
  - Row-reduce `[A | I]` to `[I | A⁻¹]`.
  - Preferred for solving `Ax = b` directly (without computing A⁻¹).

- **Cayley-Hamilton Theorem** (Theoretical only):
  - A matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation.
  - Can sometimes derive `A⁻¹`, but not practical.

### Key Insight:
> In practice, we **don't compute the inverse** to solve `Ax = b`.  
> We solve it **directly using row reduction** for better efficiency and accuracy.

## 🔷 Diagonalization

### Definition:
A matrix A is diagonalizable if:


A = P D P⁻¹

- `D`: Diagonal matrix (eigenvalues on the diagonal).
- `P`: Matrix of eigenvectors.

### Conditions:
- A has enough linearly independent eigenvectors.
- Always true for symmetric matrices.

### Use Cases:
- Computing powers of matrices: `Aⁿ = P Dⁿ P⁻¹`
- Solving linear differential equations.
- PCA in machine learning (eigen-decomposition of covariance matrix).
- Understanding system behavior and stability.

# 🔹 Minimal Polynomial (Informal Definition)

> The **minimal polynomial** of a square matrix `A` is the **simplest polynomial** (with smallest degree and leading coefficient 1) such that:
>
> ```
> g(A) = 0
> ```

It’s the **"smallest expression using powers of A"** that completely cancels the matrix.

## 🧠 Why Is It Important?

- Reveals the **internal structure** of the matrix.
- Tells you how complicated the matrix is.
- Helps decide:
  - If `A` is **diagonalizable**.
  - How to **compute high powers** of `A` efficiently.
  - Matrix behavior in **differential equations** or **linear transformations**.

## 🔑 Key Characteristics

| Property                        | Meaning                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Annihilates the matrix**      | Plugging `A` into it gives the **zero matrix**: `g(A) = 0`              |
| **Monic**                       | Leading coefficient is **1**                                            |
| **Least degree**                | Among all polynomials satisfying `g(A) = 0`, it has the **lowest degree** |
| **Unique**                      | Every matrix has only **one** minimal polynomial                        |
| **Divides characteristic poly**| The minimal polynomial is always a **factor** of the characteristic poly |
| **Includes all eigenvalues**   | All eigenvalues of `A` are **roots** of the minimal polynomial          |

## 🧪 Example (2x2 matrix)

Let:

```math
A = [[2, 1],
     [0, 2]]
We try:

- `(A - 2I) ≠ 0`
    
- `(A - 2I)^2 = 0`
    

✅ So the **minimal polynomial** is:
g(x) = (x - 2)^2
