- Goal : Choose $K_p,K_i,K_d$ appropriately
![[Pasted image 20250604121319.png]]
- Keep Ki,Kd zero, and Kp very small
- Increase Kp until neutral stability is achieved.
- The critical/ultimate gain Ku = Kp at neutral stabilty
	- The period of oscillation is Tu
- Look up Kp,Ti,Td in a table
	Classic PID : (0.6 Ku, Ti/2, Tu/8)
	P : 0.5 Ku, - , -
	PI : 

Tu = 0.1
Kp = 400
